    "## Adaptive Stepsize Control\n",
    "\n",
    "When we integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the choice of time step $\\Delta t$ can influence the accuracy and efficiency of our numerical solutions.\n",
    "This issue becomes especially important for systems that exhibit rapid changes in time and/or chaotic behavior.\n",
    "In such cases, tiny differences in initial conditions or time step selection can lead to wildly different outcomes.\n",
    "This highlights why we must continually monitor and control numerical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptive step size control** provides a systematic way to handle these challenges.\n",
    "Instead of using a fixed $\\Delta t$, adaptive methods dynamically change the time step based on error estimates at each step.\n",
    "The critical idea behind adaptive step size control is to balance two competing goals:\n",
    "* **Accuracy:** Keep truncation (local) errors within a user-specified tolerance.\n",
    "* **Efficiency:** Avoid making the time step too small, which would waste computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we estimate the local error of a proposed step and compare it to a tolerance that combines both absolute and relative components.\n",
    "If the error is too large, we reduce the step size.\n",
    "If it is safely below the tolerance, we may increase it.\n",
    "This approach automatically \"zooms in\" when the ODE solution changes rapidly and \"zooms out\" when the solution is smoother."

    "### Error Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate one of the simplest ways to estimate errors, consider advancing the solution from $t$ to $t + 2\\Delta t$.\n",
    "There are two ways to do this:\n",
    "1. Step the ODE system with a single step $\\Delta t' = 2\\Delta t$.\n",
    "2. Step the ODE system with two consecutive steps, each step is $\\Delta t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fourth-order method (e.g., classic Runge–Kutta 4), the local truncation errors differ between these two approaches.\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{One step:}  \\quad x(t + 2\\Delta t) &= x_1 + (2\\Delta t)^5 \\phi + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^6) + \\dots \\\\\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive time stepping is essential for problems that exhibit rapid, chaotic, or otherwise complex behavior.\n",
    "By continually adjusting the step size, $\\Delta t$, we ensure numerical errors remain under control while avoiding unnecessary computational overhead.\n",
    "This strategy proves especially beneficial for highly sensitive systems, where even slight changes in time steps can have dramatic effects on the calculated trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded Runge–Kutta methods, such as the Dormand–Prince (DP) family, are particularly well-suited for adaptive stepping.\n",
    "They produce multiple estimates of different orders within a single step, with the difference between these estimates serving as a direct measurement of local truncation error.\n",
    "Error control mechanisms, like the proportional–integral (PI) controller, dynamically adjust the step size based on these estimates, balancing accuracy and efficiency.\n",
    "To handle a wide range of solution magnitudes, we combine absolute and relative tolerances to form the error threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are methods like Richardson extrapolation that can formally boost the order of accuracy, embedded Runge–Kutta formulas remain the primary choice for practical error estimation.\n",
    "By default, many established software libraries (including MATLAB's `ode45`) rely on embedded DP methods for their robust performance and favorable trade-off between cost and accuracy."

    "The key philosophical shift was recognizing that nature can often be described as if it \"chooses\" a path or configuration that makes some quantity---called the action---stationary (usually a minimum, but more precisely an extremum) with respect to small variations of the trajectory.\n",

    "\n",
    "We started with the Lagrangian viewpoint of classical mechanics, where each system is described by its kinetic and potential energies.\n",
    "Instead of directly applying Newton's laws, we use the principle of least action to determine how a system evolves in time.\n",
    "This approach not only simplifies the treatment of constraints and complex coordinate systems but also unifies a wide range of physical problems under a single conceptual framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step involved translating our Lagrangian-based description into a concrete numerical procedure.\n",
    "Perhaps the most exciting part of our workflow is the use of automatic differentiation (autodiff).\n",
    "Rather than manually computing partial derivatives, we let autodiff tools do the heavy lifting.\n",
    "By defining the Lagrangian in code, we automatically generate the required derivatives and then form the corresponding equations of motion on the fly.\n",
    "This reduces the overhead of dealing with algebraic details, freeing us to focus on modeling and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we combined these pieces into a Computational Lagrangian Mechanics solver.\n",
    "To the best of my knowledge, this streamlined toolchain is not found in standard Python libraries.\n",
    "This showcases how creatively leveraging existing numerical methods can push us to the cutting edge of computational physics!"
